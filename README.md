# NaturalLanguageProcessing
Implemented different NLP algorithms like Viterbi,N-grams,BrillsTagger.
Task 1: Create a corpus of News articles. Your corpus should contain at least:o 1,000 articleso 100,000 wordsNote: you are free to download freely and publicly available News articles corpora from public websites such as: http://www.nltk.org/nltk_data/2. Task 2: Implement a shallow NLP pipeline to perform the following:o Keyword search index creation? Segment the News articles into sentences? Tokenize the sentences into words? Index the keywords into search index such as Lucene or SOLRo Natural language query parsing and search? Segment an user?s input natural language query into sentences? Tokenize the sentences into words? Run a search/match against the search index created from the corpuso Evaluate the results of at least 10 search queries for the top-10 returned articles3. Task 3: Implement a deeper NLP pipeline to perform the following:o Semantic search index creation? Segment the News articles into sentences? Tokenize the sentences into words? Lemmatize the words to extract lemmas as features? Stem the words to extract stemmed words as features? Part-of-speech (POS) tag the words to extract POS tag features? Syntactically parse the sentence and extract phrases, head words, and dependency parse relations as features? Using WordNet, extract hypernymns, hyponyms, meronyms, and holonyms as features? Index the various NLP features as separate search fields in a search index such as Lucene or SOLRo Natural language query parsing and search? Run the above described deeper NLP on an user?s input natural language and extract search query features? Run a search/match against the separate or combination of search index fields created from the corpuso Evaluate the results of at least 10 search queries for the top-10 returned articlesNote: you are free to implement or use a third-party tool such as:1.
